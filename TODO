Need an explicit method to sync an FStorage etc..

The prepare/import/cancel stuff in FImportDevice also needs an extra

Make sure that the automatic save functions always get triggered on
exit.

Remove usage of libxml.

RETARDNESS : FIconViewModel should return a struct on the stack with
the two pointers instead of requiring the
f_icon_view_model_item_free() dingus.

Split f-utils into f-pixbuf-utils, f-sql-utils etc.

intltool stuff.

Check that the messages at startup for when the library cannot be open
are sensible.

Remove berkeley db dingus?

Split f-utils?

Get rid of the ISO speed info the roll.xml?
